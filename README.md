# The Game Boy camera sniffer
A data logger to intercept analog images from a Game Boy Camera. It consists of a middle man circuit in direct derivation with the camera sensor ribbon that drops anything that it sees as data images to an SD card.

# Why ?
Because it could be fun to record data directly from the Game Boy Camera sensor before it even enters the MAC-GBD. In this case, the signal being analog, any bits per pixel definition can be recorded. The whole device is fully autonomous by drawing current on the 5V bus of the Game Boy. It works with GBA, GBC and DMG.
